I am a frehshmen at CSUF and this was my first semester taking computer science Classes

## favorite CPSC 120L Labs 
* Lab 1
  
  This was an exciting lab, as it’s now easy to understand, but it’s also an introduction to what's to come in the later labs. I also realized that if a condition is met,
   we get an expected output, and since it was my first computer science class, it was interesting to understand new things.

* Lab 6,
  
	This lab was also one of my favorites because it taught me about blackjack along with the video on what two cards
 added together to get an even higher number It was overall pretty interesting as I knew nothing about blackjack.
 
* Lab 12
  
  The last lab was also the most interesting as it used multiple functions, mainly the if and else functions, and all of the code would produce text with a particular background or color,
   making things enjoyable at the end. This lab reminds me that there is a lot more work to be done to do even more things when coding.
